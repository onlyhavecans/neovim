## Squirrel NeoVim

This repo is designed for use with [homeshick](https://github.com/andsens/homeshick) and contains all my NeoVim configurations and associated hooks.

I have this separate from my general dotfiles since I don't need all this, or even all of NeoVim on all machines I touch. Sometimes a bit of vi works fine. Yes I said vi. I still remember how to vi somehow.

My configurations is based around [LazyVim](https://www.lazyvim.org) because I appreciate an opinionated IDE.

Yes, you read that right. I like batteries included and a nice preconfigured setup I don't need to spend weeks customizing. NeoVim/LazyVim strikes the perfect balance of modern treesitter/LSP native integration, community support, and speed/clean interface. Plus I have too many years of finger memory to switch to Helix ðŸ˜†.
