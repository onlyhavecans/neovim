## Squirrel NeoVim

This repo is designed for use with [homeshick](https://github.com/andsens/homeshick) and contains all my NeoVim configurations and associated hooks.

I have this separate from my general dotfiles since I don't need all this, or even all of NeoVim on all machines I touch. Sometimes a bit of vi works fine. Yes I said vi. I still remember how to vi somehow.
